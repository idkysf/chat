Chat made better.

---

## Why?

wasteof/chat (https://wasteof.money/chat) looks really bland, and lacks some pretty cool features that would make life easier. So why not make a client for it? After all, there are clients for wasteof itself, so a chat client would be pretty awesome.

I did this for fun and as far as I know, this is the first /chat client so I suppose that's a bit of a flex if I od say so myself.

## Setup

Pretty easy setup, just clone the repo and run the commands below:

```sh
$ bun i
$ bun run --dev bun # dev server
$ bun run build # build app
```

## "License"

I don't feel like going through a bunch of licenses and shit so for now if you fork this just credit me.

I'd appreciate if additions and features were created as pull requests rather than separate forks.
